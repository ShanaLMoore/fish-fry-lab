/* You have a 500 gallon tank of water that has been used
 to hold fish that are going to be used in a Fish Fry 24hrs
 from now. The tank has a leak that is losing water at the rate
 of 10% of the remaining water every hour. If the tank drops
 100 gallons, the fish will all die (instantly). 1) Create a program
 that will solve the problem of determining if the fish will
 die if no action is taken. 2) Provide for adding additional
 gallons of water per hour to keep final value above 100
 gallons. 3) Display the number of gallons reminaing after each hr. */
